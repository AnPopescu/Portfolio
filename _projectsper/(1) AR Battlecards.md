## AR Battlecards

---

This is the current project that I was working on for my class on Virtual Reality Systems. 

This is an Augumented Reality game developed in Unity that can be deployed on Android Phones. It uses Vuforia markers printed on real life cards in order to summon little monsters on your phone screen and make them battle eachother. (Something like Pokemon Go).

Inspired by battlecards anime like Yu-GI-Oh and Duel Masters.

I have custom designed/made the cards and registered each one of them as AR markers.
