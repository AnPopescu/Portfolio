### Concept

Magic Mayhem is a web-based, third-person shooter where magic reigns supreme. Engage in intense battles using a variety of spells, from fireballs and ice spikes to acid spray and shielding spells. With its low-poly graphics and web-optimized gameplay, Spellstrike offers a fast-paced, competitive experience that can be enjoyed anywhere.

In the present Magic Mayhem offers only a single-player experience with game modes such as time-attack , capture the zone and boss battles. 

The future intention is to compete against players from around the world and become the ultimate spellcaster in this innovative crypto-powered game.
