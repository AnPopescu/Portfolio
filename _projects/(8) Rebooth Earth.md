## Concept

“Reboot Earth” is an ecology focused game which was designed by a group of young people from six countries under the organization of Goethe Institute. The process not just helped them to learn the basics of game design; it enabled them to communicate and collaborate beyond borders without prejudgements during the isolated days of Covid-19. It was also an experiment in terms of adapting to changing paradigms.

## Systems 

* Mobile camera movement
