## Concept

In Greek Gods Tower Defense, you take control of a classroom of young Greek gods still in training. As mythical creatures invade the classroom, it's up to you to strategically place these budding deities to defend their sacred space. Each god possesses unique powers, from Zeus's lightning bolts to Athena's wisdom, but be mindful of how their abilities interact. Use your gods' backpacks to reroute enemy waves and create the ultimate defense strategy.

Before the level starts , player can premade a "deck" of 4 greek gods that he can place.
Carefully managing what greek teen team you bring to the classroom can decide the difficulty of the specific encounter.
